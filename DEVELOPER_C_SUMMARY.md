## Addendum: Recent Infrastructure Fixes

### Terraform Staging Environment Deployment Fixes

**Date**: 2025-11-18  
**Context**: Series of fixes to successfully deploy the staging environment

#### 1. Network CIDR Overlap Fix
- **Problem**: `cidrsubnet` function was creating overlapping CIDR ranges
- **Solution**: Added explicit CIDR variables to `staging/terraform.tfvars`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `environments/staging/terraform.tfvars`
  - `modules/vpc/main.tf`

#### 2. IAM OIDC Provider Duplicate Fix
- **Problem**: Attempting to create duplicate GitHub OIDC provider
- **Solution**: Changed from resource to data source to use existing provider
- **Files Modified**:
  - `modules/iam/main.tf`
  - `modules/iam/outputs.tf`

#### 3. RDS Parameter Application Fix
- **Problem**: `apply_method` incorrectly placed on DB instance
- **Solution**: Moved to parameter group where it belongs
- **Files Modified**:
  - `modules/rds/main.tf`

#### 4. ALB Listener Routing Fix
- **Problem**: HTTP listener redirecting instead of forwarding to target group
- **Solution**: Changed default action from redirect to forward
- **Files Modified**:
  - `modules/alb/main.tf`

**Result**: ✅ Staging environment successfully deployed
